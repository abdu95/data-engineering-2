# Introduction 
## General
The project aims to analysis the relation between GDP and number of Olympic medals, as well as answering other queries regarding Olympic players and countries. 
## Data Source
Medals in Summer Olympic(1992-2008), country attributes and player attributes data were collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/summer-olympics-medals); while GDP data was from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
## Technical Choices
Multiple software programs are used to implement this project:

* **MySQLWorkbench**, in which we created schema *db_X_L_A* and table *athletes_medals*, and then loaded data into the table.
* **Knime**, which was used to clean data, join table and make quires.
* **Application Programming Interface**, mainly URL, to search for country GDP data from World Bank.
* **Tableau**, for data visualization and answering queries.
* **R**,
